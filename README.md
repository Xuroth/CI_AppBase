CI_AppBase

A skeleton application that includes basic authentication.

This is designed to be built upon, and is not a complete project in and of itself.

If anyone uses this, you should first install a copy of Codeigniter 3.x into your server root folder, and then install this over top. Overwrite files.
The database tables required by this application base are not currently provided, as this project is designed for personal use.

Where is this going?
I plan to continue developing this to support a wide array of features. As new features are added, I will add documentation. Mostly as a reminder to myself, but also in case anyone feels like using such a simple and inferior skeleton.
